Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

---

# Description

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

# Code Quality

Functionality of code: All code cells can be run without error.
Choice of data types and structures: Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.
Use of loops and conditional statements: Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.
Use of packages: Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.
Use of functions: Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.
Use of good coding practices: Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.
